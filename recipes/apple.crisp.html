        <li> 6 golden delicious apples, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 3/4 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 cup light brown sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup old fashioned oats</li>
        <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cold unsalted butter, diced into small cubes</li>
        <li>pinch of kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 F degrees.  Butter an 8Ã—8 baking dish, or spray with non-stick cooking spray.  Set aside.</li>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, add chopped apples, granulated sugar, 3/4 tsp of the cinnamon and lemon juice.  Stir to combine, then transfer to prepared baking dish.</li>
    <li>In a separate mixing bowl, add topping ingredients (brown sugar, oats, flour, 1 tsp cinnamon, salt, and diced cold butter).  Use a pastry cutter to cut the butter into the oat mixture, using a slight downward twisting motion, until mixture resembled pea-sized crumbs.  Alternatively, you can use two forks or even your hands to cut butter into the mixture.</li>
    <li>Spread topping over apples in baking dish, and gently pat to even it out.  Bake 40-50 minutes, until golden brown and bubbly.</li>
    <li>Serve warm and enjoy!</li>
